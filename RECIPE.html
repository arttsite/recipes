<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul type="circle">
<li>10.5 cups fresh grated coconut</li>
<li>10.5 cups all purpose flour</li>
<li>1.5 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced shallot/onion</li>
<li>1 green chilli(Optional)</li>
<li>1 sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced)</li>
<li>water as needed (room temp)</li>
<li>salt as needed</li>
</ul><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
Step1:Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly slicedNow divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls. onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. ( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors)
</br>
Step2:Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.
</br>
Step:3Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.</br>
Step4:When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough. It doesn't have to be smooth.</br>
Step5:Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.</br>
<Step6:Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options)</br>
Step7:Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.</br>
Step8:Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.
</br>
Step9:Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.<br>

<h3>Ingredients</h3><br>
<ul type="circle">
<u>For the dough</u>
<li>300 grams all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1⁄2 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>113 grams cold unsalted butter* (113g = 1/2 cup = 1 stick)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
<li>90 grams cold water (90g = 90ml)</li>
<u> the filling</u>
<li>500 grams potatoes (I use yukon gold potatoes)</li>
<li>1 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, divided (adjust to your taste)</li>
<li>11⁄2 tablespoons coconut oil/canola oil/vegetable oil</li>
<li>2 pieces of cinnamon (each around 2 inches long)</li>
<li>1 small pandan leaf cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
<li>1 yellow onion finely chopped</li>
<li>3 green chilies finely chopped</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic minced</li>
<li>2 springs of curry leaves finely chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon curry powder*</li>
<li>1⁄2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>200 grams canner mackerel/ canned tuna</li>
<li>2 teaspoons coarse ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon lime juice (1tbsp equals to 1/2 of a lime)</li>
<u>Other</u>
<li>1 liter oil for deep frying</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<u>Make the dough</u><br>
Step1:Into the food processor, add flour, salt, and sugar. Pulse a couple of times until they're mixed. Cut the butter into cubes and add to flour.<br>
Step2:Run the food processor until all the butter is mixed with flour and there aren't any lumps of butter left. The mixture should look like fine sand or large flour grains. Do not run the food processor for too long as it can increase the temperature and melt your butter. 
<br>
Step3:Add vinegar first. And then add cold water, little by little from the feed tube, while running the food processor on low. Stop the food processor when the mixture forms small lumps and gets thicker. If flour sticks together when you squeeze some, it means you have enough moisture in the dough.
<br>
Step4:Dump everything in the food processor onto the counter/pastry bench. Press them all together using your fingers, to make a large ball.
<br>
Step5:Divide into two, and roll it into two long cylinders, about 1.5 inches in diameter. Wrap both cylinders with plastic wrap. Put it into the fridge for 1 - 2 hours or until it gets hardened. <br>
<u>Making the filling</u><br>
Step1:Peel and cut potatoes into large chunks. Boil them with 1/2 tsp salt (or half of the given amount if you're doubling or tripling the recipe). When you can easily pierce potatoes with a fork, turn off the heat and drain them immediately into a colander. Leave the potatoes in the colander to cool down and dry off of moisture. 
<br>
Step2:Heat oil in a frying pan or a small wok. Add cinnamon and pandan leaves and let them fry for about 5 seconds. (be careful of splattering oil when you add pandan leaves)
<br>
Step3:Then add onion, garlic, green chilies, and curry leaves* with 1/2 tsp of salt. Saute until translucent.<br>
Step4:Then add curry powder and turmeric powder. Mix well and saute about 30 seconds until you get the aroma of curry powder and onions turn yellow in color.<br>
Step5:Add mackerel/tuna and mash it into small pieces with the back of your spoon (make sure not to add any liquid from the cans). Mix well with the onions and saute for about 1 min on medium heat until mackerel pieces coat well with the onion mixture.
<br>
Step6:Mash your potatoes until they are small chunks ( I usually press them with a large wooden spoon. You can use a masher or squeeze them by hand). Add the potatoes to the pan and saute well until everything is very well mixed.<br>
Step7:Add black pepper, lime juice, and salt to your taste.  The mixture should taste slightly acidic with a somewhat prominent lime flavor but it will balance out once you fried the patties.
<br>
Step8:Remove pandan leaves and cinnamon sticks from the mixture. Let the mixture cool completely before you assemble the patties.
<br>
<u>Making Patties</u><br>
Step1:Cut the refrigerated dough into roughly 35g discs. 
<br>
Step2:Roll one disc into a flat round shape, roughly around 2mm thick. Using a round cookie cutter (a jar/bottle cap would also work), cut the dough into a perfectly round shape, roughly around 3 .5 - 4 inches in diameter. <br>
Step3:Place about 3 tbsp of filling on one half of the round. Apply a little bit of water around the edge.
<br>
Step4:Fold one half over the other and press the edges together to seal. Press the tip of the fork over the seam to complete the seal.
<br>
Step5:Arrange patties in one layer on a plate. Refrigerate them for about 1/2 hour or until you're ready to fry them. Or store in the freezer (Check the description for freezing instructions.)<br>
<u>Fry Patties</u><br>
Step1:Heat oil in a deep sauce pan/wok/deep fryer. Keep the oil at medium temperature around 350F/175C (see notes). Make sure there's enough oil to fully submerge the patties. Add a few patties to hot oil. Fry until they are golden brown. Flip halfway through frying.<br>
Step2:When patties are golden brown, take them out of the oil using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate. If you want to keep them crispy for longer, let them rest on a cooling rack. <br>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul type="circle">
<u>For the Batter</u>
<li>1 cup Urad dal/Undu (split matpe beans)</li>
<li>1⁄4 cup Rice flour</li>
<li>1⁄4 cup all purpose flour/bread flour</li>
<li>1⁄8 teaspoon salt
<li>Thick coconut milk as needed (Depends on the consistency of the mixture)</li>
<u>For the Sugar syrup</u>
<li>2 cups Dark bro</li>wn sugar</li>
<li>1⁄2 cup water</li>
<li>2 pinches salt</li>
<u>Other</u>
<li>Oil for deep frying</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
Step1:Soak Urad dal/Undu overnight. (or 8-10 hours)<br>
Step2:Drain water you used to soak black lentils. Grind lentils into a smooth paste. Use about a tsp of water at a time if only it’s hard to grind. Otherwise no need to add any extra water. Mix the ground urad dal with rice flour and all-purpose flour. It would become a little stiff but a smooth paste. If the mixture is very dry and hard to mix add about tbsp of water and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap. Let the batter ferments for 12 hours or so until you see it has tiny bubbles/holes in it. If you live in a colder area this could take more than 12 hours.<br>
Step3:After the batter is fermented, add salt to the mixture and coconut cream one tablespoon at a time and make it into a pipable paste. Do not over-mix since you can lose the air bubbles in the batter. In case it looks flat and no air in the batter leave it for about an hour before you pipe them into hot oil. It’s important not to add too much coconut milk since it would be hard for you to get the coil shape with a runny batter.<br>
Step4:Make the sugar syrup by heating dark brown sugar, water, and salt in a saucepan. Do not overheat the syrup until it becomes bubbly. You only need to heat it through. Keep it on the stove on very low heat. (you can substitute dark brown sugar with white sugar or jaggery or even use treacle as a substitute for syrup)<br>
Step5:Heat enough oil to deep fry in a frying pan. (a flat bottom pan would be ideal). Put a bit of batter into the oil to see if it has heated enough. It should sink to the bottom first, stay for about a second, and pop onto the surface of the oil, and should puff up. If it popup immediately, the oil is too hot. Let it cool down a little bit before you pipe the batter again. Keep the piping bag closer to the surface of the oil so it's easier to get the right shape. And do not use way too much oil to deep fry. 1.5 inches deep should be enough.<br>
Step6:When the oil is heated enough pipe the batter into coils. Fry them until golden brown. When it’s golden brown immediately transfer to the warm syrup. Do not crowd the pan and soak one Pani Walalu at a time in the sugar syrup.<br>
Step7:Leave the Pani Walalu in syrup for a few seconds until it absorbs the syrup and transfer into a clean plate.<br>
